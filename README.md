# SoLo-CallMe

**Let Claude Code call you on the phone.**

Start a task, walk away. Your phone rings when Claude is done, stuck, or needs a decision.

- **Just works** - Connect to our hosted server in one command
- **Multi-turn conversations** - Talk through decisions naturally
- **Works anywhere** - Smartphone, smartwatch, or landline
- **Tool-use composable** - Claude can search the web while on a call with you

## Quick Start (Hosted Server)

The fastest way to get started - connect to our hosted MCP server.

### 1. Get a Phone Number

You need a [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com) account with a phone number (~$1/month).

1. Create account at [portal.telnyx.com](https://portal.telnyx.com)
2. [Buy a phone number](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/numbers/buy-numbers)
3. [Create a Voice API application](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/call-control/applications):
   - Webhook URL: `https://callme.sololink.cloud/twiml`
   - API version: v2
4. [Verify your phone number](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/numbers/verified-numbers) (the number you want to receive calls on)
5. Get your **Application ID** and **API Key** from the portal

### 2. Configure Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CALLME_PHONE_PROVIDER": "telnyx",
    "CALLME_PHONE_ACCOUNT_SID": "your-application-id",
    "CALLME_PHONE_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-api-key",
    "CALLME_PHONE_NUMBER": "+15551234567",
    "CALLME_USER_PHONE_NUMBER": "+15559876543"
  }
}
```

### 3. Connect to Server

```bash
claude mcp add -s user --transport http solo-callme https://callme.sololink.cloud/mcp
```

Restart Claude Code. Done!

## Tools

### `initiate_call`
Start a phone call.

```typescript
const { callId, response } = await initiate_call({
  message: "Hey! I finished the auth system. What should I work on next?"
});
```

### `continue_call`
Continue with follow-up questions.

```typescript
const response = await continue_call({
  call_id: callId,
  message: "Got it. Should I add rate limiting too?"
});
```

### `speak_to_user`
Speak without waiting for a response. Useful before time-consuming operations.

```typescript
await speak_to_user({
  call_id: callId,
  message: "Let me search for that. One moment..."
});
```

### `end_call`
End the call.

```typescript
await end_call({
  call_id: callId,
  message: "Perfect, I'll get started. Talk soon!"
});
```

2. Restart Claude Code after adding the MCP server
3. Try explicitly: "Call me when you're done"

### Call doesn't connect
1. Verify your Telnyx credentials
2. Check webhook URL in Telnyx portal matches your server
3. Ensure your phone number is verified

### Audio issues
1. Confirm phone number verification in Telnyx
2. Check TTS/STT API keys are valid
